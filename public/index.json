This machine focuses on OpenWRT router infrastructure and Wi-Fi security. It starts with an exposed FTP service and ends with a successful WPS brute-force attack that ultimately grants root access. The walkthrough below is structured for clarity :)\nTechnical Walkthrough #\rFTP Enumeration #\rI began by running a full port scan with Nmap:\nnmap -sC -sV 10.129.229.211 This revealed three open ports: FTP (21), SSH (22), and DNS (53). A follow-up service/version scan confirmed that FTP had anonymous login enabled.\nAfter connecting with:\nftp 10.129.229.211 I turned off prompting and downloaded all files:\nprompt mget * Among the files retrieved were:\nProjectGreatMigration.pdf ProjectOpenWRT.pdf MigrateOpenWrt.txt backup-OpenWrt-2023-07-26.tar MigrateOpenWrt.txt file informing me the system has reaver installed which will come in handy later. OpenWRT Backup Extraction #\rI created a folder and extracted the contents of the OpenWRT backup:\nmkdir openwrt_backup tar -xvf backup-OpenWrt-2023-07-26.tar -C openwrt_backup Inside the extracted content were familiar OpenWRT directories including /etc/, /config/, and crucial files like passwd, shadow, and wireless.\nUsername Discovery and Password Reuse #\rFrom etc/passwd and etc/shadow, I discovered a custom user named netadmin. While the shadow hashes didn’t crack easily, the config/wireless file disclosed a Wi-Fi password:\nSSID: OpenWrt Password: VeRyUniUqWiFIPasswrd1! Using this password, I tried SSH access:\nssh netadmin@10.129.229.211 Success. I was in as netadmin.\nAllowing me to obtain the user flag :)\nPrivilege Escalation #\rOnce inside, I began enumerating the network setup to identify a path to root. First, I checked active wireless services:\nsystemctl status wpa_supplicant This confirmed that wpa_supplicant was active on wlan1, indicating it was acting as a Wi-Fi client.\nInterface Roles and Hostapd #\rTo confirm which interface was acting as an AP, I checked:\nsystemctl status hostapd This confirmed hostapd was running on wlan0. Verified modes with:\niwconfig Results:\nwlan0: AP mode (master) wlan1: client mode (managed) mon0: monitor mode (for sniffing) wlan2: managed, inactive Further inspection with iw dev showed:\nwlan0 on phy0, AP wlan1 as P2P client wlan2 + mon0 on phy2, perfect for monitoring Brute Forcing WPS PIN #\rI checked for available tools with:\ngetcap -r / 2\u0026gt;/dev/null Found reaver. Perfect.\nTo identify the BSSID and channel, I used:\niw dev BSSID: 02:00:00:00:00:00 Channel: 1 Launched the attack:\nreaver -i mon0 -b 02:00:00:00:00:00 -vv -c 1 This revealed the WPA PSK:\nWhatIsRealAnDWhAtIsNot51121! Root Access #\rKnowing the system had a pattern of password reuse, I attempted:\nssh root@10.129.229.211 Password: WhatIsRealAnDWhAtIsNot51121!\nThis was successful. I grabbed the final flag from:\ncat /root/root.txt Defense \u0026amp; Remediation Advice #\rDisable anonymous FTP access and apply proper file permissions. Set ap_setup_locked=3 in hostapd to prevent WPS brute forcing. Avoid password reuse across Wi-Fi and SSH logins. Disable monitor-capable interfaces unless explicitly needed.

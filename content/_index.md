description: This is my cybersecurity portfolio where I share projects, tools, and writeups from stuff I’ve worked on — from ethical hacking practice to securing code. It’s a mix of hands-on challenges, learning experiences, and cool things I’ve built or broken (legally).

Welcome to my website!
I try to keep this website updated with lab writeups, articles, projects I’ve worked on, and tools I’ve built.

You can use the navigation above to check out my lab writeups, exploits, certifications, and even find a link to my LinkedIn if you want to connect. 

WEBSITE IS ALWAYS BEING UPDATED
